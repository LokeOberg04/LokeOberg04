            <h1>It’s a fish, Your Majesty!</h1>
            <p>I was responsible for the UI manager, Respawn/Checkpoint system and then a few small tasks such as the death animation for enemies which was heavily inspired by super smash bros where the enemy flickers, waits a few milliseconds and then goes flying off screen.</p>
            <h1>Respawn/Checkpoint System</h1>
            <p>
            The checkpoint system was very simple, essentially just a stack that holds vectors. When the player collides with a checkpoint, the checkpoint checks if it collided with a player and if it did it calls the checkpointmanagers activateCheckpoint() function.
            </p>

                The activateCheckpoint() function just pushes the player's position onto a stack that we then can teleport the player to when needed, this is done in the respawnPlayer() function which checks if there are any checkpoints in the stack. If there are checkpoints in the stack it takes the newest one and teleports the player to that position. If the checkpoints stack is empty then it teleports the player to 0,1,0.

                The death animation works by moving the enemy away from the player and slightly up until they are off screen and then they are deleted. When the animation first starts we check which way it should fly by comparing its position on the X axis to the player's position and then we flip the isDead bool to be true. In the update we check if isDead is true and if it is we move the enemy in the direction that we calculated earlier. To know when the enemy should be deleted we take the bounds of the enemy, Calculate the frustum planes from our camera. And then check if our bounding box is inside the frustum planes.

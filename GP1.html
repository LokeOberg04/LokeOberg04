            <h1>Dashing Dinos!</h1>
            <p>
            This was my first and shortest group project so a lot of it was learning how to properly communicate and plan a game with other people. This was also my first experience with Perforce so our group had a lot of trouble getting the game to work on everyone's computer and to fix that we had to have a bunch of different scenes since some scenes would crash or not load correctly for some people. For this group project I spent a lot of my time helping my colleagues since this was really early into education and I was already familiar with programming a little bit from past experiences. I was also tasked with making the power up system.
            </p>
            <h1>
                Powerups
            </h1>
            <p>
                The powerups were pretty weirdly made, essentially the “powerups” were just empty game objects with a few variables. All the actual code was inside the player and not the powerup which makes the player script very cluttered and bloated.

            <p>
                The powerups logic was pretty simple, for example the Coin Magnet would just grab all gameobjects with the tag Collectible and move them towards the player. This should have been done in a different way since the FindGameObjectsWithTag() function is pretty expensive since it basically searches all active gameobjects and checks their tag. This isn't really a problem in this game since it's so small so there aren't that many game objects to look through but it should still be done in a different way to build good habits.

                Conclusion and Takeaways
            </h1>
            <p>
                For a first real group project with random people that I have never met before I think this project went pretty well, I learned a lot and I definitely used the knowledge I gained from this in my future projects. Since the project was only 2 weeks I didnt learn alot about programming but I did learn alot about how it is to work with other people in the industry.
